                    <p>As an ownerless poor little dog, he was found wandering the grounds of the Yale University campus in New Haven, Connecticut while members of the 102nd Infantry were training.</p>
                    <p>Stubby hung around as the men drilled and one soldier, by then Private John Robert Conroy, developed a fondness for the dog.</p>

                    <p>A few months after Stubby first embedded with the troops at the Yale, the 102nd Infantry prepared to ship out to France for the war.</p>
                    <p>Private Conroy, not wanting to leave Stubby behind, hid him in his Army-issue greatcoat and aboard the ship S.S. Minesota.</p>
                    <p>Upon discovery by Private Conroy’s Commanding Officer, Stubby flashed a patriotic salute like a regular soldier earning him and then became the Infantry's mascot.</p>

                    <p>One month after landing in France, the American Expeditionary Forces entered the Western Front.</p>
                    <p>The raw troops of the 26th Division, where Stubby and Private Conroy were under, were brought to northeastern France, to train with more experienced French forces.</p>

                <div class="happenings">
                    <p>Stubby had his first war experience on February 5th at Chemin des Dames, boosting troops morale on the front lines while under constant fire day and night for over a month.</p>
                    <p>He was brought for morale, but he ended up saving countless lives as he located and delivered medical aid to wounded soldiers in the no man's land.</p>
                    <p>And since he could hear the whistle of incoming artillery shells before humans could, he became very adept at alerting his unit to duck for cover.</p>

                <div class="happenings">
                    <p>Later, Stubby was injured by mustard gas but survived, he then became extremely sensitive to the presence of even trace amounts of gas.</p>
                    <p>Then one morning, while most of the troops were sleeping, the division was assaulted by an early morning gas launch.</p>
                    <p>Stubby first smelled the gas then ran up and down the trenches barking and biting soldiers, working to rouse them from slumber to sound the alarm and getting everyone to safety.</p>

                    <p>For his outstanding service and heroism, Stubby became a Private First Class on 5th of April, his well-earned first military rank.</p>
                    <p>As the 102nd Infantry joined an attack on the German-held town of Seicheprey, they met a hail of grenade fire by retreating enemies.</p>
                    <p>Priv. 1st Class Stubby, who took part in the attack, had shrapnel wounds to his leg and chest, earning his second Army wound stripe.</p>

                    <p>Around this time, PFC Stubby had recovered and was back in action.</p>
                    <p>But while he was recovering from his wounds, he was walking around the hospital visiting wounded soldiers, boosting morale wherever he went.</p>
                    <p>His mere presence lifted the morale of wounded soldiers recovering from injuries suffered on the front.</p>

                    <p>He bit on the legs, causing the spy to trip and fall, then continued to attack  and hold the spy until the Allied soldiers arrived.</p>
                    <p>For capturing an enemy spy, PFC Stubby was put in for a promotion to the rank of Sergeant by the commander of the 102nd Infantry.</p>
